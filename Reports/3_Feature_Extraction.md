# Feature Extraction
-----

<p> The Concentration of air pollutants is influenced by meteorological conditions. We identified five features: <i> temperature,
humidity, baometer, wind speed and weather (such as cloudy , foggy , suuny and speed) </i>. Figure below shows the correlation between 
PM<sub>10</sub> and the first four features. using the data collected from August to Dec 2012 in Beijing where each row/column denote 
one feature and a plot means the AQI level of the location. 
</p>
<p>
In particular, a high wind speed disperses the concentration of PM<sub>10</sub> and high humidity usually cause high concentration.
A high pressure will result in a good AQI. The impact of temperature is not clear in this case , but a good AQI is more likely 
when temperature is high and humidity is low , or when pressure is high and temperature is low. 

</p>
Should we consider:

<ul>
<li> Traffic related features</li>
<li> Human Mobility features</li>
<li> Road network related features</li>
<li> Point of interest related features</li>
<ul>

Real time 
Recurrent neural network (RNN)  is an extremely powerful model that has revolutionalized many application domains. The long short term memory is a variant of the RNN that has proven to be very much powerful and effective. In this work we extend the applicability of LSTM - a variant of RNN - to the task of predicting air quality in urban areas. To make this model more intrepretable and understandable we will be combining state-of-the-art variant of the  LSTM  called tree-lstm with Hidden Markov Chain.    </p>

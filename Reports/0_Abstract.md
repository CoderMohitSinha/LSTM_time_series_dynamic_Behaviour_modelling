<p> 
In  recent times urban air quality has been of major concerns to all stakeholders both in the private and public sectors due to the increase in anthropogenic factors that affects the concentrations of major air pollutants in these regions. On the other hand,  the resources to maintain air-quality-monitor stations across the lenth and breadth of even a small region can be quite challenging and would be influenced by a number of factors-- traffic volume , meteorological condition </p>
<p> In this paer we propose, Recurrent neural network (RNN)  is an extremely powerful model that has revolutionalized many application domains. The long short term memory is a variant of the RNN that has proven to be very much powerful and effective. In this work we extend the applicability of LSTM - a variant of RNN - to the task of predicting air quality in urban areas. To make this model more intrepretable and understandable we will be combining state-of-the-art variant of the  LSTM  called tree-lstm with Hidden Markov Chain.    </p>

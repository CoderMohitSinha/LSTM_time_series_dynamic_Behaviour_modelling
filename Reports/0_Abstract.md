<p> 
In  recent times urban air quality has been of major concerns to all stakeholders both in the private and public sectors due to the increase in anthropogenic factors that affects the concentrations of major air pollutants in these regions. On the other hand,  the resources to maintain air-quality-monitor stations across the lenth and breadth of even a small region can be quite challenging and would be influenced by a number of factors-- traffic volume , meteorological condition </p>
<p> In this paper we propose to learn  the air quality index using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based on pre-existing data. In particular, we use a variant of the RNN called the long short term memory (LSTM) which has proven to be powerful and effective for such task. Our approach was to exploit various combinations of tree-based LSTM and HMM.    </p>
<p> 

We evaluated this approach with extensive experiments based on five real data sources obtained in _____ , _____ and ________. The results shoe the advantage of our approach over one/two/three categories  of nbaselines including decision tree, SVM and Vanilla LSTM.

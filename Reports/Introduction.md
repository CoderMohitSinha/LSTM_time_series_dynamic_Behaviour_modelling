## Introduction.

<p>Air quality and its temporal and spatial variations are largely influenced by the nature of anthropogenic activitties associated with various gaseous and particulate emissions and the  set of prevailing meteorological conditions there. Epidemological studies have established associations between air pollutants and daily excess in mortality (Dockery and Pope 1984) and morbidity (Kassomenos et al ,2008). Poor air quality has both acute as well as chronic health impacts (Nastos et al 2010). Suspended particulates matter , respirable suspended particulate matter,  Oxides of Nitrogen a nd sulphur ,  and ozones are among the major common air pollutants. Concentration of such pollutants are subject to alter depending on the local topography, source emission and surrounding meteorological conditions. However among these variables meteorological parameters are mostly responsible for causing variations in the ambient concentrations of air pollutants.(Banerjee et al 2011). The environmental regulatory vodies (CPCB,2009) provide guidelines for the maximum permissible levels of various air pollutants </p>
<p> Concern about air pollution in urban regions is receiving increasing importance worldwide (Chattopandhyay et al , 2010). The urban areas can be viewed as dense source of enormous anthropogenic emission of pollutants which could alter the atmospheric composition, chemistry, and life cycles in its downwind regimes, extending over hundred kilometres(Gupta et al 2008).</p> 
<p>
As for the health impact of air pollutants, air Quality Index (AQI) is an important indicator for general public to understand easily how bad or good the air quality is for their health and to assist in data interpretation for decision making processes related to pollution mitigation measures and environmental management. it is defined as an index or rating scale for rating the  daily combined effect of ambient air pollutants recorded at monitoring site (Kumar and Goyal, 2011).

To ensure human safety of humans, particularly in urban areas it is important to monitor the daily ambient air quality on a regular basis.To save cost of man-power, resources and instrumentation requirement of such monitoring , it is desirable to develop models which are robust, viable and of high predictive capability. To do such we turn to various machine learning models.</p>

<p> 
Various predictive models offer tools for forecasting air quality base on past measuremnts. Atmospheric dispersion models, used to predict the ground level concentration of air pollutants around the sources (Cimorelli et al 2005 ; EPA , 2005;Kesarkar et al ., 2007,; Bhaskar et al 2008) require precised knowledge of several source parameters and meteorological conditions (collett and Oduyemi  1997). The Statistical model attempt to determine underlying relationship between a set of input  data and targets . Since air quality may be very complex and exhibit  non-linearity , linear models will not be suitabke (Singh et al 2012).

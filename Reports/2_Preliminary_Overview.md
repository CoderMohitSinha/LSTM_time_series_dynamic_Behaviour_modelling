<u><b> Air Quality Index </b></u>

<p> AIr Quality Index (AQI) is a number used by Government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air is currently is. An increases in AQI is likely to have an adverse efect on human health, in particular vulnerable people --senior citizens, allergic or sick citizens-- are particularly at risk. Computing the AQI requires an air pollutant concentration from a monitor or station. The function used to convert from air pollutant concentration to to AQI varies by pollutants and is different  from countries to countries. Air quality index values are divided into ranges and each range is assigned a descriptor and a colour code. In this work we used a standard issued by United States Environmental Protection Agency as shown in table below.    </p>

  AQI | Values Levels of Health Concern| Colors      |
------------ | ------------|----------|
0-50| Good (G)| Green
51-100 | Moderate (M) | Yellow
101-150| Unhealthy for sensitive groups (U-S) | Orange
151-200| Unhealthy (U) | Red
201-300| Very Unhealthy (VU) | Purple
301-500 | Harzardous | Maroon

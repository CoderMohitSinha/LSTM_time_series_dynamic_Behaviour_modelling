This folder containds the preprocessed data set that was used during the project and A brief description is given below
    
      1. Impurities value for PM10, PM25, NO2, Ozone and CO in 4 diffrent regions from city of Skopje and each region comprise 
      6 locations
      2. At each stage we predict the time series evolution for one of these impurities. e.g PM10
      3. We added other impurities for there is Correlation among impurities.
      4. The data contains 7 regions and each region has its own impurity readings
      5. The impurity readings for the 7 locations will be fed together into the LSTM since the impurity 
      levels between the locations may affect each other since they are near.
      6. We also scrapped weather data to to see the correlation bwetween weather condition and impurity level.
      
      
      NB:This will also be updated

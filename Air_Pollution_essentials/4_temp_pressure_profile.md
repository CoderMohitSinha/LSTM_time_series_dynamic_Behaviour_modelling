#### Atmospheric pressure profile.

<span>
The total atmospheric pressure is the sum of the partial pressures from each of the gases present according to its mixing ratio. Hence
the great majorit of pressure is due to N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and Argon. See image below:

The following should be noted:
  * Atmospheric pressure is highest at sea level
  * Pressure decreases rapidly with altitude but not at a constant rate
  * Rate of change is rapid in lower atmosphere and diminishes significantly at upper atmosphere

The atmosphere consist of 5 thermal layers where temperature either increase or decrease with altitude.
These layers are <strong> Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Thermosphere, and Exosphere </strong>.

<strong> The *troposphere*:  </strong>
  1. It is the lowest thermal layer
  2. It is about 11 miles thick above the equator.
  3. It is progressively thinner towards the poles. The thickness is related to temperature. Hence, troposphere is thickest at      the equator where temperature is high.
  4. The upper limit of troposphere is called *tropopause*
  5. The temperature at the top of the layer is 15<sup>o</sup>C  while the temperature at the bottom is -60<sup>o</sup>C.
  6. It contains almost all water vapor and clouds in the sky
  7. Almost all weather phenomena and processes occur at this layer. All precipitations occur in this layer too.
  8. Accounts for 80% of atmospheric mass
 
<strong> The *troposphere*:  </strong>
  1. It extends beyond the troposphere to about 30 miles above sea level
  2. It is the zone of maximum ozone concentration
  3. Temperature increases with increasing alttitude
  4. Little or no vertical streaming but strong horizontal winds called *Jet streams* occur.
  5. Source of heat for this layer is at the stratopause where absorption of UV radiation by ozone occurs.
  
The remaining three layers are not discussed here.

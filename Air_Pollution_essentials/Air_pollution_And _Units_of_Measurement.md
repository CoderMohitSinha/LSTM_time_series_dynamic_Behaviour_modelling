### Air Pollution
-----

<span>
According to the **Tenth report of royal commission on Environmental polluition**:

*Air pollution* is the <span style="color:red">introduction</span> by man  into the environment of substances or energy liable to cause hazard to human health, harm to living resourcs and ecological systems,damage to structure or amenity or interfere with the legitimate use of the environment.

This definition is very broad and for practical purposes we will adopt the following definition:
 
 *Air pollution* is the solid, liquid or gaseous material emitted into the air from stationary or mobile sources, moving subsequently through an aerial path and perhaps being involved in physical or chemical transformations before it can have 
any environmental impacts. It can either be *Anthropogenic* that is occuring as a result of human action or *biogenic* which occurs as a result of activities of other living organisms.

### Units of Measurement

 <span>
 Two sets of concentration units are often used:
  1. Volumetric
  2. Gravimetric
  
*Volumetric* units specify the mixing ratio between pollutant volume and the original air volume - that is the ration number of pollutants gas molecules to the total number of air molecules.

*Gravimetric* units uses the mass of the material per unit volume of air. It is approraiate for particles and gaseous air molecules measurement.

### Abbrevations for  Volumetric and Gravimetric units 
-----
  Volumetric |             |          | Gravimetric      |
------------ | ------------|----------|-------|
Parts per million (micro) | 10<sup>-9</sup> | ppm | mg m<sup>-3</sup> 
Parts per billion (nano) | 10<sup>-9</sup> | ppb | &mu;g m<sup>-3</sup> 
Parts per trillion (pico)| 10<sup>-12</sup> | ppt| ng m<sup>-3</sup>

We can convert from volumetric to gravimetric units and viceversa. This will involve using the Avogadro's number, Molar mass of the gaseous molecule and standard volume.  We can also make correction for non standard temperature and pressure using the general gas equation (Boyle and Charle's law).

### Constituents of Air
--------

<span>
Air consists of a number of gases that have a fairly constant average proportions both at different horizontal and vertical positions and at different height. The average mass of dry air is  **28.95 gmol<sup>-1</sup>** .

Proportions of molecules in dry air is shown below:

Molecule | Symbol | Proportion by Volume          |
-------- | ------ | -------- |
Nitrogen | N<sub>2</sub>| 78.1% 
Oxygen| O<sub>2</sub>| 20.9%
Argon | Ar | 0.93%
Carbon dioxide | CO<sub>2</sub>| 370 ppm
Neon| Ne| 18 ppm
Helium| He | 5 ppm
Methane | CH<sub>4</sub> | 1.7 ppm
Hydrohen | H<sub>2</sub> | 0.53 ppm
Nitrous Oxide| N<sub>2</sub>S| 0.31 ppm

Mixed into this quite uniform population of atmospheric molecules is a large range of additional materials that vary greatly in concentration both in space and time:

* Sulphur dioxde ( SO<sub>2</sub> )
* Oxides of Notrogen ( NO<sub>x</sub>)
* Hydrogen sulphide ( H<sub>2</sub> S)
* Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>)
* Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)
* Volatile Organic Compound (VOC)
* Persistent Organc molecules (POC)
* Non Biogenic particles
* Biogenic particles

### Water in the Atmosphere
--------
<span> 
 The table above only represent the composition of dry air - without water molecules. The gases listed above have long residence times in the atmosphere, are well mixed and their concentration are broadly same anywhere in the atmosphere. Water is very different due to its unusual properties at normal temperature and - it is the only substance which is present in all its 3 phases (solid , liquid and gas). There is continuous transfer between the 3 [jases depending on condition.
 
 Proportion of water molecule in atmosphere at any place and time depends on both local conditions and on history of air. The temperature of air determines the maximum amount of water vapour vapour that can be present The water vapour pressure at this point is called *saturated vapour pressure , (svp)*. SVP can be modelled as :
 
 <p align="center", style="color:red;"> e<sub>s</sub>(T) = 611 * exp(19.65T/273+T) Pa </p>
 
 Where e<sub>s</sub>(T) is the saturated vapour pressure in Pa. Ambient (local actual) vapor pressure e<sub>a</sub> may be any value between zero and e<sub>s</sub>. The ration of actual to saturated vapor pressure is called *relative humidity* often expressed as percentage. If water vapor is evaporated into air, then vapor pressure will increase towards e<sub>s</sub> but can not exceed it.

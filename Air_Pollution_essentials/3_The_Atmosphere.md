### The Atmosphere
-----
<span>

  * The atmosphere is a mixture of gases surrounding celestial bodies (in our case the celestial body is planet Earth and we say that air is mixture of gases and particles that make up the Earth atmosphere)
  * Atmospheric gases originate from gases released from the interior of the earth by volcanism and subsequently modifies by plants and animals
  * Atmospheric gases are held in place by forces of gravity
  * Atmosphere may contain both solid and liquid impurities
  * The atmosphere is densest at sea level and decreses with increasing altitude. Hence almost 98% of the atmospheric gases are found within 16 miles of the earth surface.

1. Common atmospheric gases
2. Green house gases (CO<sub>2</sub> for example)
3. Atmospheric particulates

### Importance of the  Atmosphere
-----
<span>
By understanding the impact or usefulness of the atmosphere, we will understand why we need to keep it should be kept clean and monitored. And this will also serve as a justification for the relevance of pur studies.

 * It is the main source of oxygen and carbondioxide needed by animals and palnts.
 * It maintains water supply through the mechanism  of hydrogen circle
 * It prevents temperature extreme and functions as great insulator
 * It provides protection from cosmic and ultraviolet radiation
 * It provides protection from the impacts of small-sized meteorites by causing them to be incinerated through friction.

### Green House Gases in the Atmosphere
-----
<span>
Common green house gases in the atmosphere include:

1. CO<sub>2</sub>.
2. ChlorofluoroCarbon.
3. Ozone.
4. Water Vapour.

These green house gases allow the passage of short wave solar radiation. They disallow the passage of long wave infrared radiant energy  from earth back to space. Hence radiant energy is allowed to accumulate to produce a warming effect or green house effect.
 
 The effect of global warming inlude: rise in sea level and flooding in coastal areas, hotters summers and severe droughts, more rains and longer growing seasons in high altitude.

### Vertical Composition of Atmosphere: Homosphere and Heterosphere
-----
<span>
The vertical composition of the earth is divided into *homosphere* and *heterosphere*

<p><i>Homosphere:</i> The composition and percentage of gases in the lower 50 miles of the atmosphere are homogeneous and uniform. This forms the homoshpere. It inludes the <strong>Troposphere, Stratosphere and Mesosphere</strong> </p>


<p><i>Heterosphere</i> The composition and percentage of gases above 50 miles are not uniform due to little or no vertical mixing. This forms the heterosphere. Gases in the heterosphere are layered according to their molecular mass. The layered gases in hererosphere from top to bottom are : <strong>Hydrogen, Helium, Oxygen, Nitrogen</strong> </p>

<p> The Ozonosphere is a continuous layer of maximum ozone concentration between 9 and 30 miles. </p>

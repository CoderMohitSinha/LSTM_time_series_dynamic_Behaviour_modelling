<span>

  * The atmosphere is a mixture of gases surrounding the surrounding the earth.
  * Atmospheric gases originate from gases released from the interior of the earth by volcanism and subsequently modifies by plants and animals
  * Atmospheric gases are held in place by forces of gravity
  * Atmosphere may contain both solid and liquid impurities
  * The atmosphere is densest at sea level and decreses with increasing altitude. Hence almost 98% of the atmospheric gases are found within 16 miles of the earth surface.

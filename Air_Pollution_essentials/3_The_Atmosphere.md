### The Atmosphere
-----
<span>

  * The atmosphere is a mixture of gases surrounding celestial bodies (in our case the celestial body is planet Earth and we say that air is mixture of gases and particles that make up the Earth atmosphere)
  * Atmospheric gases originate from gases released from the interior of the earth by volcanism and subsequently modifies by plants and animals
  * Atmospheric gases are held in place by forces of gravity
  * Atmosphere may contain both solid and liquid impurities
  * The atmosphere is densest at sea level and decreses with increasing altitude. Hence almost 98% of the atmospheric gases are found within 16 miles of the earth surface.

By understanding the impact or usefulness of the atmosphere, we will understand why we need to keep it should be kept clean and monitored. And this will also serve as a justification for the relevance of pur studies.

 * It is the main source of oxygen and carbondioxide needed by animals and palnts.

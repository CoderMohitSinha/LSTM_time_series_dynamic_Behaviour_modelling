Background
---------------------------------------

The project is about Modelling Dynamic behaviour using Recurrent Neural Network. In particular we will be using Long Short term memory in this project (as an example of RNN). The implementation will be carried out using Tensor Flow. In addition in this project we will be modelling Air pollution as an example of a real life phenomenon that can be modelled as a time series using LSTM and tensorflow as our forecasting and modelling tool.

This project counts as a Semester Project  and is part of the requirement for a Master Degree in Communication Systems at Ecole Plytechnique Federale de Laussane.

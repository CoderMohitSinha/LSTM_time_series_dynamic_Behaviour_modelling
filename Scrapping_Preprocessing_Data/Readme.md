## Data Scraping And Preprocessing
--------------
<p>
Data is important for any Machine learning algorithm in order to achieve good forecast. Most times we might need to scrap  
<b> (Data Scrapping)</b> such data 
from the online sources. It goes without saying that such data will contain a lot of noise in addition to the required 
data values. 
The aim of data preprocessing is to take care of this.

In addition whether, regardless of whether we scrap online for data or we have the data set ready-made from different sources, there are times when 
some values might be missing. There might be some information in missingness. This part of the project aims to exploit various possibilities available 
for dealing with missingness.

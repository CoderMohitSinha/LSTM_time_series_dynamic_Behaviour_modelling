### Tutorial On Tensorflow
-----

<span> 
<p>Since we will be using tensorflow to build our model we will provide some tutorials and tips on tensorflow.
We will first discuss a general description of the tensorflow mechanism and paradigms- which might defy a little bit from common mainstream programming languages. After this  we proceed to build  <b> Neural nets models</b> . Since we can't build a good model without good data analysis, we will provide a quick recap of useful <b>exploratory data analysis</b> techniques.</p>
<p>
<b>How to use the Tutorials: </b>
The tutorials will follow a sequential order. From the simple tensorflow hello word example,  to the main simple calculations and then to building of model. Lastly we will add ways to optimize a general neural models. Each tutorial consist of IPython notebook numbered in order in which it is to be studied - from simple to fairly difficult concepts.

### NOTE THIS!
--------------
We will focus mostly on building  Neural nets models - other non-neural nets models are also possible with tensorflow. There are plenty of tutorials to get started on the theoretical underpinnings of neural nets. Some of these are provided under the heading "resources" just below.
